# Iris-Flowers-Classification
The code performs the classification of Iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. It starts by loading the Iris dataset from a CSV file, dropping the 'Id' column, and encoding the species labels into numerical values (1, 2, and 3) for the classification task. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data used for training and 30% for testing. A k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier with k=6 is trained on the training data. After training, the model is used to predict the species of Iris flowers in the test set. Finally, the code calculates and displays the accuracy of the KNN classifier as a percentage, providing a measure of how well the model can classify the Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
